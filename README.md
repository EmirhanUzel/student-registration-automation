# Student Registration Automation
A simple student registration automation application.
This project lists the students added from the interface in the interface and adds them to a database defined in localhost and backs them up.
# Requirements
- Python (3.x recommended)  
- PyQt5 (for user interface)  
- MySQL (for database)

- In the otomasyon.py file, the db = mysql.connector.connect() section must be configured with your own local MySQL server settings. The application will work properly only if you replace the connection details with your own.
